# Automatic Question Paper Generator

## Introduction  
The **Automatic Question Paper Generator (AGEQ)** is designed to streamline and automate the process of generating examination question papers. By leveraging **randomization techniques**, the system efficiently selects unique and non-repetitive questions from a predefined question bank. It is intended to **save time**, **minimize manual effort**, and **ensure fair distribution of questions**.

## Features  
- **Automated Question Paper Generation**: Generates unique question sets from a question bank.  
- **Randomization Algorithm**: Ensures no question is repeated within a paper.  
- **Question Categorization**: Organizes questions by subject, topic, and difficulty level.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for administrators to input and retrieve questions.  
- **Customizable Paper Settings**: Allows customization of total marks, number of questions, and question weights.  
- **Storage and Retrieval**: Saves generated papers for future reference.  

## Problem Statement  
Traditional question paper generation is **time-consuming and prone to errors**, with challenges such as:  
- Manual selection of questions, leading to **repetition** and **bias**.  
- Lack of an **automated system** to dynamically select and arrange questions.  
- **Difficulty in managing large question banks** efficiently.  

## Proposed Solution  
This project presents a **smart, automated question paper generation system** that enables educational institutions to generate **randomized, structured, and balanced** question papers based on predefined criteria.  

## System Requirements  

### **Hardware Requirements**  
- **Processor**: Pentium IV 2.6 GHz or higher  
- **RAM**: 512 MB or higher  
- **Hard Disk**: 20 GB free space  

### **Software Requirements**  
- **Operating System**: Windows XP or later  
- **Frontend**: C, C++  
- **Backend**: Notepad (for storing questions)  
- **Compiler**: Visual C++ (Visual Studio 2010)  

## System Design  

### **Modules**  
1. **User Input Handling**: Accepts user input for selecting subjects, topics, and difficulty levels.  
2. **Validation & Processing**: Ensures correct input formats and verifies question availability.  
3. **Randomization Algorithm**: Generates unique sets of questions dynamically.  
4. **Question Selection & Sorting**: Selects appropriate questions based on weightage and topic distribution.  
5. **Output & Export**: Saves the generated question paper as a **text file** for easy printing and access.  

## Workflow  
1. **Input**: Administrator selects question categories, total marks, and number of questions.  
2. **Processing**: The system **randomly selects** questions from the database based on predefined criteria.  
3. **Output**: A well-structured **question paper** is generated and saved for further use.  

## Benefits of the System  
- **Saves Time**: Eliminates manual effort in question selection.  
- **Ensures Uniqueness**: Reduces question repetition across multiple papers.  
- **Scalability**: Can accommodate **large question banks** for different subjects.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimizes dependency on human effort for paper creation.  

## Project Timeline  
- **Literature Survey**: Completed  
- **Requirement Analysis**: Completed  
- **System Design**: Completed  
- **Implementation**: In Progress  
- **Testing & Finalization**: Upcoming
